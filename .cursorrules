## Coding Conventions

### Server Actions
- **Always use Server Actions** for server-side operations instead of API routes
- Server Actions should be defined in `app/actions/` directory
- Use `"use server"` directive at the top of action files

### Form Handling
- **Always use React Hook Form** with **Zod** for form validation and handling
- Use Zod schemas for validation
- Integrate React Hook Form with Server Actions for form submissions

### React Imports
- **Always use direct imports for hooks**: `import { useState, useEffect, useCallback } from 'react'`
- **Always use direct imports for utilities**: `import { forwardRef, memo } from 'react'`
- **Use type-only imports for types**: `import type { ComponentProps, ElementRef } from 'react'`
- **Remove unnecessary React imports**: React 17+ doesn't require `import React from 'react'` for JSX
- **Only import what you use**: Don't import React if you're only using JSX (no hooks or React APIs)
- **shadcn/ui components exception**: Do not modify shadcn/ui components in `components/ui/` - they use `import * as React` and `React.ComponentProps` patterns by design

### Prisma Types
- **Always use generated Prisma types** from `@/prisma/generated/prisma/client`
- **Never manually define types** that duplicate Prisma-generated types
- **For models with relationships**, use the pattern: `Model & Prisma.ModelGetPayload<{include: {...}}>`
- **Match type includes** with actual Prisma query includes for type safety
- Example:
  ```typescript
  import { OrganizerApplication, Prisma } from '@/prisma/generated/prisma/client';
  
  type ApplicationWithRelations = OrganizerApplication & Prisma.OrganizerApplicationGetPayload<{
    include: {
      tenant: {
        include: {
          owner: {
            select: {
              id: true;
              email: true;
              firstName: true;
              lastName: true;
            };
          };
        };
      };
    };
  }>;
  ```
