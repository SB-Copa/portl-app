## Coding Conventions

### Server Actions
- **Always use Server Actions** for server-side operations instead of API routes
- Server Actions should be defined in `app/actions/` directory
- Use `"use server"` directive at the top of action files

### Form Handling
- **Always use React Hook Form** with **Zod** for form validation and handling
- Use Zod schemas for validation
- Integrate React Hook Form with Server Actions for form submissions
